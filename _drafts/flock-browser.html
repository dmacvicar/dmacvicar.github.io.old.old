<p>
    I started trying Flock today.<br />
Flock is a browser derived from Firefox which has some nice extensions like blogging and flickr integration (yes I am writing this from Flock). I was forced to use it as my upgrade to lastest alpha unstable version of SUSE broke my Firefox (the risks you take when using development snapshots), so I said myself "good moment to give Flock a try".</p>
