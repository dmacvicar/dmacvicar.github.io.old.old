<p>In the past, I was using Picasa to upload my photos.</p>
<p>These are the showstoppers in other photo management applications:</p>
<p>Shotwell:</p>
<p>Shotwell is the one I like most. It is fast, stable and the user interface is very clean. It has some problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>When it import pictures, it creates a date-based folder structure. It works with pre-existing pictures though and keeps the structure intact.</li>
<li>You can rename the "event" so it gets displayed as "John's wedding" instead of the date, but this information is only persisted in the database. I would not mind keeping the date structure but don't want any relevant information going into the database. A solution would be to keep the event name in the file itself (EXIF), <a href="http://redmine.yorba.org/issues/3567">but this is not yet implemented</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>F-Spot:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/f-spot/+bug/104807">It does not support videos</a></li>
</ul>
