<p><a href="http://software.newsforge.com/software/05/11/02/2056250.shtml?tid=152&amp;tid=78&amp;tid=138">Interesting story</a> on Newsforge about the current state of cryptographic hash algorithms.</p>
<p>Crypographic hash functions are sometimes very useful. Even if you don't need all the security they provide for encryption purposes (fingerprints), they are really nice when you just need a hash function in your program (they are just popular hash functions after all). Why writing one from scratch?. Cache subsystems are a good example.</p>
<p>Today, I also read that <a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/">QEMU</a> now can <a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/qemu-accel.html">accelerate execution</a> using a kernel module, in a similar way <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> does. I have to try that. I tried Xen3, (which is a completely different approach) a couple of weeks ago, but it crashes my XServer.</p>
