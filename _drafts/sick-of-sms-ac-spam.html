<p>Yes, most of my friends have signed up to their service. The problem is that sms.ac asks for a msn or aol username and password during signup. Most of the users are so used to be asked for a password that they don't notice when a strange site is asking you for one password you use for another service. Well, what those guys do is that they actually login into the msn account and steal the addressbook and then spam all the people listed there(hey that is me!) with more sms.ac invitations.</p>
<p>What is funny is that some people that have complained either about spam or strange billings in their blogs, have reveived big CEASE AND DESIST letter from lawyers of this company telling them to stop doing illegal activity (without saying what!, looks like a template letter to scare people) or they will get sued. So you get spam and cannot complain publicaly otherwise you get threatened about getting sued.</p>
<p>If you use gmail, just go to the Create Filter option in the top of the main page, and follow those steps to create a filter.</p>
