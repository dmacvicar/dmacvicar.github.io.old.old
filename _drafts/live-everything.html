<p>Microsoft <a href="http://blogs.pcworld.com/techlog/archives/001050.html">announced today</a> they will offer some classic applications, including Office, as a hosted service. Yes, there is nothing to see yet. They setup a very unfinished website at live.com, which is no more than a rss reader with weather support. And it is called Windows live!. Buzz Buzz. That would not be so bad if they were the first ones doing hosted applications.</p>
<p>But, vaporware, and late as always. I really don't understand. Announcing products which aren't done yet, but that already exist in the internet from other companies, and announcing them with that "we are innovating" way, and probably they will get patents for it in the future.</p>

<p>If you don't want to wait, and want to see a real stuff. An <a href="http://osx.portraitofakite.com/logon.htm">Web OS interface?</a>. Want to see a live <a href="http://online.thinkfree.com/">office suite?</a>. Didn't like it?, what about a 100% <a href="http://numsum.com/">AJAX spreadsheet?</a>. Sorry, Did you want a <a href="http://www.writely.com/">word processor</a>...ah, you meant a <a href="http://www.kiko.com/">calendar!</a>. Did I mention <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Project Management</a>?</p>
<p>More Live stuff. This time with some innovation in it. Do you like social networks applications?. <a href="http://www.filmloop.com/whatis.html">FilmLoop</a> is a live picture loop, which show the pictures of your social network.</p>
