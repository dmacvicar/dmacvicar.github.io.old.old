<p>I have setup my kde4 environment for first time since I moved. After it was done, I noticed my backtraces had "optimized out" values instead of memory addresses, so I had to recompile everything with -O0.</p>
<p>Right now, libkopete and Kopete itself compiles with kdelibs4_snapshot <a href="http://img295.imageshack.us/img295/5232/kopete415to.png">[ Screenshot ]</a>. No protocols compile yet (except testbed). The initial porting work was started by Grej and IIRC Matt and Olivier have been doing more on it. So I started porting the base classes like Account, Protocol and ContactList to stop using the Qt3 support list classes. I have MSN half compiling too.</p>
<p>I wanted to play with testbed to try the concepts I discussed with Will in our meeting at my place last weekend. Sadly, KABC compiles but did not work at all.</p>
<p>Loading my big addressbook crashes on the detach() function of when trying to set some value. I did not dig into the KShared stuff yet.</p>

<p>I must figure whats going on here. Testbed will be very useful to play with the new integration concepts that have been floating in Will's head since some time. After he explained me some stuff I got some ideas how we can do it in small iterations. I would like to do it in the kde4 codebase, because our 0.12dev branch could not be broken at that level IMHO.</p>
