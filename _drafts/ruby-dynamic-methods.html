<p>The <a href="http://www.ruby-lang">Ruby language</a>, has a feature call method missing, which allows your class to react to unknown method calls without raising a unknown-method error.</p>
<p>This allows a class to answer to whatever method is called. Which is very useful if you are writing a Ruby binding to a component you query also dynamically, because with this way method_missing act as a gateway only, forwarding the message (method name) and the parameters, after doing the appropiate conversion.</p>
<p>Yes, That is what I am doing right now :-)</p>
<p>A good example of this feature, is the example found in the Ruby Reference Book, which is a class that answers to roman numbers methods, using help from the built in conversion functions.</p>
<div>
<div class="CodeRay">
<div class="code">
<pre>class Roman
  def romanToInt(str)
    # ...
  end
  def method_missing(methId)
    str = methId.id2name
    romanToInt(str)
  end
end</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The result is:</p>
<div>
<div class="CodeRay">
<div class="code">
<pre>r = Roman.new
r.iv  -&gt;  4
r.xxiii  -&gt;  23
r.mm  -&gt;  2000</pre>
</div>
