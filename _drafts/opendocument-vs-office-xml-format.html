<p>There is an <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20051125144611543">article on Groklaw</a> comparing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument format</a> to the new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/">Office 12 XML format</a>. If you want a summary of the article just read this <a href="http://braincore.blogspot.com/2005/11/wtf-is-this-xml.html">blog entry</a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2005/11/22/495876.aspx">Brian Jones, from Microsoft, claims</a> that all the known patent and licensing issues of the scpecification are no longer issues. That cool. GPL programs could convert from OpenDocument to their format. I hope they don't expect with these changes Office XML format to be adopted as a standard. It is still a single company effort, and as you can see with the links above, it seems to suck!</p>
