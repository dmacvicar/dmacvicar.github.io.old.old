<p>Today it was a very busy day. We helped <a href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/blog/77">Will</a> to move to his new flat. </p>
<p>I got a <a href="http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10101&amp;storeId=5&amp;productId=46916&amp;langId=-3&amp;parentCats=10121*10392*13786">new desk</a> from IKEA. Will got the same. I had move all the furniture to make some place for the desk. Now my sofa is just behind the desk, in case I want to see DVDs.</p>
<p>What is the desk for? I got a computer. Finally!. It means I could start doing some development soon.</p>
<p>I got a cold, but was able to "survive" during the week. The temperatures are every day lower. Everyone tells me I haven't seen anything yet!!!.</p>
<p>News from Chile? We have lot of mobile phone scam/fraud in Chile. They call you simulating being from the phone company, and then tell you have won a prize. Today a friend told me he got a SMS message "You  won a 4x4 <b>Lan Robert</b>". Well, they meant of course <a href="http://www.landrover.com/">Land Rover</a> ;-)</p>
