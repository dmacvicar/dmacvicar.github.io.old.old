I usually keep an eye on free Windows applications in order to recommend them when friends/family using Windows need help.

With Firefox, ThunderBird and others, Windows users don't really need to go trough the pain of using Internet Explorer. However, for long time they did not have something cool as [amaroK][2] to play music and they were forced to the mediocrity of Windows Media Player.

[Musikcube][1] seems to be a free alternative for Windows user. If you try it, please give me feedback.
