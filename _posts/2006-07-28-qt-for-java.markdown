Still in Boston. WIll told me during the breakfast that [Qt for Java development][1] Tech Preview was released. It features nice stuff like coexistence between C++ and Java code and [Eclipse integration][2]. Great news, especially this quote:

>  "In addition to integrating the complete Qt API with the beneÔ¨Åts that Java provides (notably garbage collection), Qt Jambi enables C++ programmers to easily integrate their Qt code with Java. This is done using the Qt Jambi Generator which reads the code of an existing C++ library and generates a Java API for it."

Yesterday night, I updated [Tor][3] and [TorK][4] packages in [security:privacy repo][5] in [OpenSUSE Build service][6] to the last released versions.
