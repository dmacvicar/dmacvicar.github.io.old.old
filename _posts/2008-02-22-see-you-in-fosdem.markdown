Busy week. More meetings than usual.

On Thursday I had the nice opportunity to meet [Zonker][4], our new community manager while he was in our NÃ¼rnberg offices. Got lot of really interesting feedback from him on how we should promote and build community around YaST.

I was going to blog about the YaST user interface library, but [Stano has it][1] in his new blog (great move!).

Stefan Haas has been doing great progress taking advantage of the new [libzypp 4.2 features][2] for the [PackageKit][5] libzypp backend. Right now I am preparing my laptop so may be I can show something on FOSDEM, where I will be attending together with Thomas Goettlicher from the YaST team, and a [big bunch][6] of other SUSE/Novell collegues.
