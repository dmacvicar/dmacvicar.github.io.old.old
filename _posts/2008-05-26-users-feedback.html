    I got some feedback from users about managing software.</p>
<p>[Ra&uacute;l Moratalla][5]. who has been blogging  about [using 11.0 ZYpp/YaST in 10.3][3], suggests two changes:</p>
<p>* Updated packages filter.</p>
<p>Adding that feature is really easy. However, 11.0 is almost out.</p>
<p>* New packages filter</p>
<p>This shouldn't be impossible, but I don't have an idea on how to do it. I think we don't have the information on when a package appears in a repository, and even worse, we don't keep information about the previous refresh when finishing one.</p>
<p>John Tomas asks and suggests an easier way to [remove applications][1]. I think the use case is valid, but I don't like the [exact proposal][2], specifically, I don't like user interfaces with trees. And adding more check boxes for repo removal clutters the interface more. Moreover, I think this usecase is just part of a more generic one, how to install applications, without worrying about "packages". This problem is already being solved by, for example, Ubuntu Appinstaller.</p>
<p>This problem could be solved in various way.</p>
<p>* Packages could be "tagged" as such.</p>
<p>However that requires changing the current world, therefore it won't work.</p>
<p>* Do a .desktop file -&gt; package mapping.</p>
<p>Ubuntu appinstaller does this by scanning the complete distribution archive, and generating special metadata from it. This metadata is distributed as a package called appinstaller-data. This method is sane, but the approach of scanning the distribution archive won't work with 3rd party repositories.</p>
<p>Stephan Binner has a [prototype for the same][4] concept on openSUSE, called app-installer.</p>
<p>Any other ideas on how to solve this problem?</p>
