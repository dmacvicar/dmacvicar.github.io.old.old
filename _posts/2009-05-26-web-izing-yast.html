<p>
    As you may know, are working on making [YaST functionality accessible via the web][4]. With this we mean not only browser. The current prototype has two parts: a generic web service (REST like API) and a web browser client.</p>
<p>Stefan Schubert [announced last week][1] a new snapshot for developers. You can find packages [in the build service project][2]. The packages are named yast2-webservice and yast2-webclient.</p>
<p>This is very early code. It is not fast, and the web client is not yet using all user interface possibilities that ajax gives, but there are we going :-).</p>
<p>If you are an experienced user, and you get it running, you may be interested in getting it running from source code by reading [our development web page][3]. Both the webservice and the webclient are rails applications. Developing modules is also easy! Just show up in irc (freenode) #yast.</p>
