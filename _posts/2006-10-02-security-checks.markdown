[Coolo][1] just enlightened me with valuable information. Being in the EU actually doesn't mean no-passport-check. From [wikipedia][2]:

> The 1985 Schengen Agreement is an agreement among European states which allows for common policy on the temporary entry of persons (including the Schengen visa) and a border system. A total of 26 countries – including all European Union states except the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, but including non-EU members Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland – have signed the agreement and 15 have implemented it so far. Border posts and checks have been removed between Schengen countries and a common 'Schengen visa' allows access to the area. However, the agreement does not cover residency or work permits for non-EU nationals.

thanks coolo!
