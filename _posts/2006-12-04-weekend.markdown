From [Inge Wallin][2]'s blog, I learned that [OpenDocument][3] is now a [ISO standard][1].

I updated tor and torK packages from the security:privacy repository in the openSUSE build service. I updated also gnash (flash player replacement) to version 0.7.2.

Yesterday I went to see [Shantel // Bucovina Club][4]. The party was good and i liked the music. You can get some sample mp3's from Shantel [here][5].
