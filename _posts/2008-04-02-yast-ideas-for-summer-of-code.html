<p>
    Because the Google Summer of Code deadline was extended, I just added two projects I consider interesting for YaST:</p>
<p>###Automatic generation of YCP bindings</p>
<p>Right now, if you want to access low level libraries from YCP code, you have two options:</p>
<p>* Create manual bindings, may be with help of /usr/share/YaST2/data/devtools/bin/generateYCPWrappers script. (used by package-bindings and libyui ycp bindings )<br />
* Wrap your library using swig, and then generate perl bindings from that, and then use the module using YaST perl bindings (libstorage is accessed this way).</p>
<p>This problem could be solved in various ways:</p>
<p>* Create a [SWIG][4] module that allows ycp glue as output.</p>
<p>This approach would get all the swig parsing magic for free.</p>
<p>* Extend generateYCPWrappers so it could wrap any C library in a easy and automatic way. C++ is not required, as YCP is not object oriented.</p>
<p>Expected result:</p>
<p>Get package bindings or libstorage output which don't depend on perl bindings and are automaticaly updated if the target API changes.</p>
<p>* Required knowledge: C++, YaST2, languages<br />
* Skill level: medium<br />
* Willing mentors: me!</p>
<p>### Build YaST using [cmake][3]</p>
<p>YaST builds using autotools and a automated layer of scripts over that (called y2conf, y2make, etc).</p>
<p>Some modules as libzypp and friends, yast2-qt and ruby bindings build using cmake.</p>
<p>It would be great to build complete YaST using cmake. This would bring benefits like:</p>
<p>* Access to the CTest test framework<br />
* out of the box out of source builds<br />
* Easier and more intuitive.</p>
<p>This task means:</p>
<p>* making yast2-core to compile using cmake<br />
* create devtools skeletons for modules and agents using cmake<br />
* add support for devtools utilities which may break<br />
* port all modules. (porting 3 would be a challenge, the others is mostly mechanical work once core and some problematic ones compile).</p>
<p>Automating the conversion of modules would also be a goal.</p>
<p>* Required knowledge: cmake, building, packaging<br />
* Skill level: easy<br />
* Willing mentors: me!</p>
<p>If these projects aren't for you, there are [more ideas][2] in the wiki page. Check it out!.</p>
