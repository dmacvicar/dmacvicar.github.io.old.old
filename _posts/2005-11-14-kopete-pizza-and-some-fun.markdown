Saturday, Kopete hacking session with Will at my place. Not much code done but set down lot of stuff for KDE4 regarding contact list integration with the KDE addressbook.

Then we decided do go out. Lissan came too. So first some pizza and beer. Will seems to be a wine expert now. He paid EUR 25 for a glass of wine, oh...wait!!!!

Then some dancing. I was really missing it.
