<p>Vaadin 7 is out since some time. I want it to give it a try together with Scala and my favorite build system for Java: gradle.</p>
<p>So, based on <a href="https://github.com/Softhouse/orchid/tree/master/se.softhouse.garden.orchid.scala.demo.vaadin">this skeleton</a>, I updated it to work with Vaadin 7. Mind that you need to provide scaladin yourself, as version 3 is not yet released.</p>
