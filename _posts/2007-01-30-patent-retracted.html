    I [blogged yesterday][2] about Microsoft patenting prior art. Today, they have [apologized and retracted the patent][1].</p>
<p>&gt;Many thanks to the members of the community that brought this to my attention &mdash; and here's the latest. The patent application was a mistake and one that should not have happened. To fix this, Microsoft will be removing the patent application. Our sincere apologies to Michael K&ouml;lling and the BlueJ community.'"</p>
<p>Ok. They did it, but? This raises lot of questions and proves lot of things.</p>
<p>* The U.S. software patent ecosystem is a mess.<br />
* How many similar "stolen" ideas has Microsoft filed or patented?</p>
<p>Seriously I don't believe this was a evil move from somebody trying to steal from BlueJ, but I do think this is the consequence of a  business model and company culture, where they abuse an already screwed system, and try to flood the patent office with crap they even call intellectual property.</p>
