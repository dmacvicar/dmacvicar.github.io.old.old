<p>
    We have cleaned up the main pages of [libzypp][1] and [satsolver][2], mainly to introduce a new feature.</p>
<p>Since today, there is developer documentation generated on every svn build from our cruise control system (continuous build), available for trunk and branches.</p>
<p>ZYpp documentation has already qute some articles and the API is very good documented, still, it will be enhanced in the following months to take advantages of having the documentation always available. SP2 branch documentation will be available soon.</p>
<p>For SAT solver, we have moved the existing documentation into the Related pages of the generated documentation (which already contains very useful articles) and we will do every possible effort to document the API too (which is almost empty right now :-/ ).</p>
