* [The 50 Worst Artists in Music History][1] is the biggest piece of crap ever written. How can you put Live, The Doors and Gipsy Kings there?. Well, in the same magazine, there is an article called [500 CDs You Must Own: Classic Rock][2], and they include "The Doors: The Very Best of the Doors]. Consistency?.  
* You can see my brother playing in his University [here][3].  
* My chilean friends Cristian and Rodrigo [met again to play some Megadeth songs][4].
