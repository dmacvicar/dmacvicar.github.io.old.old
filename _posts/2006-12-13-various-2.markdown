* openSUSE 10.2 had a great reception. The feedback about the light updater and YaST improvements are positive.  
* What do you think Chile's media and people is talking about? [Blogged it apart][1].  
* My brother sent me this [video of Hans Rosling at TED Conference 2006][2]. Check [this website][3] after seeing the video.  
* NÃ¼rnberg is starting to freeze  
* Bought the [Rapid GUI Development with QtRuby][4] book, but still haven't had time to look at it. I have played with QtRuby a lot anyway.
