<p>I have released kopete-facebook 0.1.4 which fixes idle status of contacts and message sending.</p>
<p>I still have some important bugs, which I hope I can fix before the openSUSE 11.2 release.</p>
<p>From those known bugs, one is the inability to reconnect (go offline and offline), which is due to the &ldquo;myself&rdquo; contact using the email as userid, which is in turn due to a Kopete limitation of needing to know an id, but facebook sends it after login. I have tried so many hacks (like switching the myself contact at runtime), but all have other side effects.</p>
<p>Another one is a crash at exit, which I still can&rsquo;t understand. Help appreciated.</p>
<p><em>Note: this plugin is not affiliated with Facebook in any way.</em></p>
<p>Should appear <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=ALL&amp;p=1&amp;q=kopete-protocol-facebook">here</a> soon (or <a href="http://github.com/dmacvicar/kopete-facebook">build it yourself</a>).</p>
