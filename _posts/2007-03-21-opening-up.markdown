We are transitioning to public mailing lists for [YaST][1], [LiMaL][2] and [ZYpp][3]. So if you are interested in development on these technologies, subscribe now!.

Today I managed to get ZYpp CacheStore in a good state and seems to be reasonable fast for writing. Still lot of work needed integrating it with the tags-format parser.

Before going to bed, I had a short chat with Sebastian Sauer about [Kross][4] and some [hacks][7] I would need to use in order to get the script manager in Kopete.

Also, fast read on the announced Adobe [Apollo runtime][5] and its [demo][6].
