<p>
    Yesterday I was able to compile opensuse-updater with cmake. The solution was to look in [KPilot][1] build system. I did not realize kde3_automoc figures QObject classes looking for a .moc include in  the implementation file instead of looking for Q_OBJECT in the header. I can understand this, because sometimes you define some quick QObject classes when doing test programs in one implementation file. Still, took me a while to figure why it was not working.</p>
<p>Moving the current updater backends to KDE generic components was easy. It still lacks a way to select a default component.</p>
<p>Performancing, the Firefox blogging add-on I use, was renamed to [ScribeFire][2].</p>
