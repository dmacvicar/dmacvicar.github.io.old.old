![Google earth screenshot][4]

I commented this to some people long time ago. While I was installing Google earth on my dad's pc. I noticed a [Qt][1] [dll] on the files installed. What does that means? Google earth was developed over a multiplatform toolkit, and it would not be very hard for Google to make Linux and Mac versions from the same codebase.

Well, it is [here][3], for Linux and Mac!
