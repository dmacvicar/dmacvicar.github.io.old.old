[Lenz][1] is now [using the build service][2], and his packages are [here now][3], what are you waiting for?. Cool people use the cool build service.

Next step? make community. Once you have enough packages in your home project find who are using them, and create a project and share maintainance with other people.  
Right now the organization is weird. Subversion has it own project. I would like to see them in a vcs project, so Lenz could move mercurial there in the future.

Why use it? because it is free and does a great job. Also the SUSE team working on it s only cool people, in order to guarantee a cool product.  
It will be easier as well to create a catalog of available repositories from the community, and a nice way to present them to the user, to add at own risk, without need to know urls.

Also, if you want to document something, create a tutorial, etc. Use the wiki!
