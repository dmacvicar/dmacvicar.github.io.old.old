    Just a note to you all [lazy journalists][1] that love to copy paste news from one site to another without doing some googling to research the facts.</p>
<p>&gt;OpenSUSE Drops ZENworks, Opens YAST<br />
&gt;By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols<br />
&gt;April 27, 2007<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Analysis: Novell's community Linux is dropping support for its all-too-often annoying ZENwork client, while finally open-sourcing SUSE's older YAST software installation and system administration tool.</p>
<p>A simple query for ["yast gpl"][2] shows that YaST is opensourced, in fact GPLed, since 2004 or so. What we did was opening up the repositories.</p>
<p>Formerly, the YaST external code repository was a snapshot of the internal one. It was synced on every release. Now, we will develop only on the external one, so you can follow real time commits, or participate.</p>
