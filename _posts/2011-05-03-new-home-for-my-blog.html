<p>My blog was hosted at a non-for-profit hosting for years. They gave me<br />
an excellent (free) service and never had any issues with my wordpress<br />
installation.</p>
<p>Sadly one day they decided to delete old (unused) accounts, and they<br />
did it with a script, that after detecting an account was not used,<br />
proceeded to delete the account.</p>
<p>My account was flagged incorrectly as inactive. So the script deleted<br />
the account.</p>
<p>I had backups, but as their claimed to have data redundancy and daily<br />
backups, I only did those twice a year.</p>
<p>The worst part. The script had another bug: it also deleted the backups.</p>
<p>There goes my blog. I lost a bunch of posts which I (half) recovered<br />
from google cache. I lost lot of images and the original markdown<br />
source of the posts.</p>
<p>So there goes also my last motivation about administering anything. My<br />
blog, as my email and pictures have done for years, moves to the<br />
cloud.</p>
<p>I am still not 100% convinced with Posterous. But lets give it a try.</p>
