Martin Schlander [writes][2] to [zypp-devel][1], giving the first feedback on the topic for alpha6. While he reports lot of issues, his first paragraph is really encouraging:

> I've played a little with alpha 6 - dvd install of x86\_64. Generally the new libzypp fully lives up to the high expectations that have been built up - the start up speed and the low ram usage is really a blessing. Almost too good to be true.
