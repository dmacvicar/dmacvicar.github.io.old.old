    Well, Italy is the world-champion, and I must say they did quite good. I am also happy for Germany for the well deserved 3rd place.</p>
<p>I have to say it again. Soccer is dying. Matches are boring. Why not doing a penalty worldcup instead? Everytime 2 players go for the ball you know already the end of the scene, one of them or both grabbing its own leg and simulating pain. Zzzzzzz.</p>
<p>I wonder if EA Sports will introduce Zidane's new movement in the next FIFA game. If not, you can play [here for now][1].</p>
