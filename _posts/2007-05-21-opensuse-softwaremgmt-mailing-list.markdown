We have a new mailinglists:

This mailing list has one mission: bring the people involved in different  
projects having to do with package management, together.

Like:

* ZYpp developers  
* Smart, YUM, etc developers and users.  
* Autobuild & build service  
* Updater applets and YaST modules.  
* Community

in order to:

* Define metadata formats, standardize, push upstream, create specifications and centralize the knowledge.  
* coordinate features in one component to be used by other components.  
* discuss ideas to make the user experience better (how to make downloading metadata faster?)  
* coordinate community projects in order to integrate them with other components.  
* Discuss having common codebase for tools like metadata generators, validators, packaging tools, etc.

To subscribe to the lists, just send an email like this: opensuse-softwaremgmt+subscribe@xxxxxxxxxxxx
