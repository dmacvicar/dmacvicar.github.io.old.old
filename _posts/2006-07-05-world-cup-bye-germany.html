    This worldcup is so boring. Long 0-0 matches and full of delays, fouls, and non-play stuff. If I am happy about Italy is because they provided me 2 minutes of soccer action I was expecting to get for the whole match.</p>
<p>I am not sad about Germany, after seeing Ballack doing fake fouls, I completely banned the team from my favorites. I can tolerate exagerating the fouls, but inventing a non-existing one is another problem.</p>
<p>I am not sad about Chile not being in the world cup. Not as long as soccer players keep having this star status.<br />
Normal people get up early and work 8 hours per day and receive a reasonable amount of money. If they do bad, they get fired. Or they get less money. Chilean "stars" don't seem to take their job seriously.</p>
<p>Italy is the world champion already, in football acting. Just look at this video of the Italian team training:</p>
<p>Soccer never was so boring like it is these days.</p>
