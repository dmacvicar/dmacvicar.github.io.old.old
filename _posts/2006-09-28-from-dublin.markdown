Here I am. Arrived yesterday after a nice flight and a stressing connection in Frankfurt. Survived crossing streets. Still can't undertand the logic behind the traffic lights. The city is very very expensive.

I met lot of people. Yesterday I had the pleasure to meet Antonio Larrosa and Pedro Jurado. We had chinesse food. All the Kopete guys (Michael, Olivier, Will) were there. Today I met Carsten Pfeiffer.

Trying to do some work on QRdf, getting into KDE4 as much as I can (I was completely outdated), and playing with QCA build system.

My cold hasn't gone yet, I still feel very sick.
