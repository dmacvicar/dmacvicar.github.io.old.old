<p>Packager&rsquo;s favorite dashboard got a new version. Most patches were contributed by <a href="http://mlandres.blogspot.com/">Michael Andres</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>follow links to a package with different package  name.</li>
<li>adapt to changed API to retrieve submitrequests.</li>
<li>support &lsquo;changes=1&rsquo; in ini-inifile to print changelogs per section (like -c)</li>
<li>osc no longer takes the md5 as revision.</li>
<li>cleanup changelog diff temp files</li>
<li>suppress changelog diff if source does not provide changes ( like obssr)</li>
<li>let changes diff consider only repos that actually provide changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Get it from [the build service], or visit the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/osc_plugins/Overview">home page here</a>. You can read the <a href="http://duncan.mac-vicar.com/blog/archives/530">introductory post here</a>.</p>
