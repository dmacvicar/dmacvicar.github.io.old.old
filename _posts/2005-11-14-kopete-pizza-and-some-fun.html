<p>Saturday, Kopete hacking session with Will at my place. Not much code done but set down lot of stuff for KDE4 regarding contact list integration with the KDE addressbook.</p>
<p>Then we decided do go out. Lissan came too. So first some pizza and beer. Will seems to be a wine expert now. He paid EUR 25 for a glass of wine, oh...wait!!!!</p>
<p>Then some dancing. I was really missing it.</p>
