Packager’s favorite dashboard got a new version. Most patches were contributed by [Michael Andres](http://mlandres.blogspot.com/).

- follow links to a package with different package name.
- adapt to changed API to retrieve submitrequests.
- support ‘changes=1’ in ini-inifile to print changelogs per section (like -c)
- osc no longer takes the md5 as revision.
- cleanup changelog diff temp files
- suppress changelog diff if source does not provide changes ( like obssr)
- let changes diff consider only repos that actually provide changes.

Get it from [the build service], or visit the [home page here](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/osc_plugins/Overview). You can read the [introductory post here](http://duncan.mac-vicar.com/blog/archives/530).
