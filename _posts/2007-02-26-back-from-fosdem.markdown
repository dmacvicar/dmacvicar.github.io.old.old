Yesterday we flew back from Brussels. I was very tired.

* The event was great.  
* The curry chicken sandwiches still suck.  
* openSUSE developer's room offered around 18 talks.  
* Got some zypp work done. First time I am so productive in an event while carrying a laptop  
* Saw a [OLPC machine][1] live.
