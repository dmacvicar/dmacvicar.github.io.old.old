<p>It has been long time since I blogged. Mostly because I was not at home and when I was I did not feel like doing something in the computer other than listening music.</p>
<p>I had to do a quick visit to the States because work, and then my brother came from Paris to my place to spend Christmas together. I showed him NÃ¼rnberg and then quick trips to Prag (my 2nd time, and the third is coming&hellip;) and Berlin for new year.</p>

<p>I got a <a href="http://www.typhoon.de/en/art.php?p=751">hard disk based mp3 player</a>. The cool thing is that it can play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg">ogg files</a> and also works as a standard usb-storage device. It has its problem though. Like most player, the jukebox database is completely proprietary.</p>
<p>Emailing the company did not work as it was a rebranded product. Emailing the original makers resulted only in getting ignored.</p>

<p>After playing with <a href="http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdeutils/khexedit/introduction.html">khexedit</a> for a while I was able to figure the simple fixed field length format of the binary database. I wrote a test program using Qt and Taglib (thanks Scott, it rocks, so simple&hellip;) to recreate the database for my collection. I haven&rsquo;t however yet figured the index files. Also, I have no idea how to read the FAT short names so I have to mount has VFAT to copy and keep the nice names, but as MSDOS to generate the database and see the shortnames the player stores in the database. Once I figure out the indexes, it should work.</p>
<p>If it does, I plan to write an <a href="http://amarok.kde.org">amaroK</a> media device plugin (no idea how to resolve the mount issue here).</p>
