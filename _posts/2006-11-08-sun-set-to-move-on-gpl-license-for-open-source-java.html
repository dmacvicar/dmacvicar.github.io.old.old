<p>
    &gt;Sun Microsystems has talked a lot about putting Java into an open-source license. Now it's ready to move.</p>
<p>&gt;The company is very close to announcing that it will put the mobile (ME) and standard (SE) editions of the Java platform into the GNU General Public License (GPL), with the Java Enterprise Edition and GlassFish reference implementation (currently open-sourced under Sun's Common Development and Distribution License, or CDDL) to follow, several industry sources said.</p>
<p>( [from CRN][1] )</p>
<p>If this happens, just remember Trolltech announced [Qt Jambi][2] back in July. So another cool free stack to develop on.</p>
