    Many years ago, people predicted that snail mail would decline as result of the growing usage of email. Well, e-commerce has resulted in millions of packages being sent by snail mail and postal services are making more money.</p>
<p>This is interesting, because in another market, music and movie entertaiment, they have been unable to come with something innovative, and instead of helping the boost of digital entertaiment, they tried to protect the CD and DVD markets via lobby, abusing and spreading , uncertainty and doubt about copyright laws, and making customer their enemies. [Whose have made digital music a profit][3], are not the same ones selling CDs. They failed to understand what customers want and keep trying to sell people something they now use only as fan collection items.</p>
<p>The internet will never make a company die. The internet kills markets at the same time it creates new ones. Whose die are the ones not wanting to accept it, and therefore not moving fast enough.</p>
