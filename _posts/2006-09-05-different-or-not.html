<p>
    [according to eweek][1], Microsoft Shield research project, developed a malware shield</p>
<p>&gt;"We basically intercept the Web page, inject our logic and transform the page that is eventually rendered on the browser," Wang said. "We're inserting our layer of code at run-time to make the Web page safe for the end user."</p>
<p>My question is, how different is this from the opensource project [Privoxy][2]?.</p>
<p>Privoxy is available since 1997-1998, if we take in count Junkbuster, the software Privoxy was based on.</p>
<p>&gt;Privoxy is a web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for protecting privacy, modifying web page content, managing cookies, controlling access, and removing ads, banners, pop-ups and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a very flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes. Privoxy has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user networks.</p>
