    On Monday night we came back from Barcelona. We did not arrive until Tuesday morning though. The airplane had problems before taking off and we lost our connection to N&uuml;rnberg in Frankfurt. Lufthansa sent us to an hotel. On Tuesday, directly from the airport to work.</p>
<p>New year in Barcelona was nice. [The place we chose][1] to go after dinner was great. I can't post photos yet because I forgot my camera in Barcelona.</p>
<p>My brother went back to Paris today. I fly today to Chile. My first time since I moved to Germany.  Excited!!!</p>
