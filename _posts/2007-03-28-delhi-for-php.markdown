[Delphi for PHP][1] was released. The IDE has nothing to do with the Delphi-Pascal language. It is just a Rapid Application Development Environment where you can "draw" your applications and generate database front-ends without much trouble. The IDE is proprietary.

The good news is that the IDE generates PHP code based on [VCL4PHP][2] (Visual Class Library) which is opensource.
