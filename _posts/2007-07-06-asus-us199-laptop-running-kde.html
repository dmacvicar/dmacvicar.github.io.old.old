    &gt;One of the biggest news stories out of this year&rsquo;s Computex wasn't of a new chipset, GPU, or graphics card, but rather of the announcement of the ASUS Eee PC, a small, slim, and light portable computer that is priced at $199. Introduced by Jonney Shih, Chariman and CEO of ASUS at Intel&rsquo;s keynote address the first day of the show, the Eee PC has already made headlines world wide.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;The Eee PC&rsquo;s main competition is the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project that originally aimed to bring to market a laptop priced at $100 for children in developing countries. However, the OLPC project has seen numerous delays and even a price increase to the $170 range.</p>
