20 days until FOSDEM, but our openSUSE team has already [all the information about our developer room and talks available][1].

I will be doing [a talk about what are we doing with package management][2].

Don't miss this nice opportunity to meet lot of community members in real life and also having 2 days of open source and belgian beer.
