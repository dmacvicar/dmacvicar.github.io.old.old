<p>
    Martin Vidner succeeded  in [making possible  to use YaST UI:: from the language bindings][1]. This means you could write a complete module in Perl, and get the benefits of the abstracted Qt/ncurses/gtk user interface.</p>
<p>These changes means that my Ruby bindings will be able to support it too.</p>
<p>I also got the code as yast2-bindings-ruby in the build service, it doesn't build yet, but soon will appear in the home:dmacvicar project.</p>
<p>Srinivasa Ragavan  is working on [Desktop status awareness][2], which means trying to do useful tasks when you are away from your computer. I pointed him to the [Kopete motion-auto-away][3] plugin I hacked some years ago in order to set the user away in the messaging client if no motion was detected in a webcam stream.</p>
