<p>
    My old homepage was a mixture of handmade php pages and the blog was powered by [blogger][1]</p>
<p>However I wanted to mix my old KDE blog, with this one, and provide feeds to planet-like aggregators based on categories. Yes, I don't like the idea of my weekend photos to appear in a tech-aggregator. And blogger does not yet support categories, and every day it seems to suck more.</p>
<p>After playing with wordpress and the [markdown][2] plugin, it became confortable enough to switch. And with the help of [a simple script][3] I found in the net I was able to convert most pages to the simplistic markdown. I was sick of using html to write posts. Not because WYSIWYG editor are not good, but I want to store my posts in a more human readable format.</p>
<p>Let's see how it goes.</p>
