This week [arstechnica][6] has a really nice selection of articles:

* [Komodo Edit][2] 4.3 [was released][3], which is the first version of this scripting editor released as opensource. The editor is based on Mozilla XUL technology, which talks very good about its extensibility. I could not find a tarball with the source, only svn repository and binary tarballs.

* [Nice article about filesystems][4].

* [Article about Firefox 3 memory consumption][5].
