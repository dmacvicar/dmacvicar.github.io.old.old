Yeah, they are open since quite time. But I mean really, open. In my [last post][1] I wrote about Google PicasaWeb and why it is so difficult to switch between social applications once you already chose one and ahve a considerable amount of connections already.

But [Flickr just announced][2] they are willing to open their API to competitors if they also provide a complete API and give access to them. Sound great. I am looking forward to be able to add people from PicassaWeb.
