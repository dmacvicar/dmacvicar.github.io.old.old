    Sometime ago from a comment in Slashdot I found my self in this website [Shelley the Republican][1]. You can find [a lot in the Wikipedia article][3], where you can find also links to the articles about Linux:</p>
<p>&gt;Linux Being an European threat to America [1], caused a disturbance among the GNU European community, as expressed in some European message boards . [2]<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;The article claimed that Linux was based on Marxist and Communist principles, as well as used by notorious terrorist Osama Bin Laden. The article also claimed that the Operating System was extremely insecure and vulnerable to security exploits.</p>
<p>The site is a bit exagerated. The writing style is intentionaly intolerant and ignorant, using missinformation like facts and giving stupid and ignorant opinions about topic the writer has no idea about, like Linux.</p>
<p>It could be easily a satire. But as Einstein said:</p>
<p>&gt;Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe.<br />
&gt; -Albert Einstein</p>
<p>So another website was created, [Shelley Uncovered][2], which tries to reveal the stupiness of every post in Shelley's blog.<br />
But now they report Tristan, one of the writers of Shelley's blog is threatening with suing. Wait, wasn't it a satire?.</p>
<p>To be honest I dont't know. I do think it is exagerated and obvious. Hackers are communists, Punks ans Gothics are satan fans. Linux is a treat to the USA economy. Google is evil. Linux is stolen (from SCO) and ilegal code. Of course she does not know the 2 most important Linux companies are american. She doesn't know also about the SCO case or the Linux source code license.<br />
Also,  U2 is black metal ;-)</p>
<p>An ignorant with opinion, that's the easy way to make the complete world angry, hehe.</p>
<p>But tiemsche wrote something interesting in Shelley Uncovered: </p>
<p>&gt;Don't waste your time, man! Seriously!<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Shelley's blog is too exaggerated to be real. It is so obvious they make small little mistakes (like saying "In Flames" is a Finnish instead of a Swedish band) to provoke people so they vent all their anger.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Really, I think Shelley is 20 year old computer geek from Germany that listens to Heavy Metal and spits on the church who makes a laugh about people like you who take it all serious and start a critical blog about it. You are doing them a favor with this. I do not think that you are peeve in Shelley's eyes which is probably your intention. Reaction like yours is exactly what they are seeking for.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Do you really think she would have allowed a link in her comments if this wasn't all a fake?<br />
&gt;When I first read Shelley's blog I was just like you. I was about to start in which I would tell her that she is nothin but a stupid bi***. I did some research and found there is another Shelley at <a href="http://shelleytherepublican.blogspot.com/">http://shelleytherepublican.blogspot.com/</a> who is stupid Republican as well but who is less provoking. I guess this Shelley is the Original, the one you are complaining about is a parody, it is irony.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;It is up to you what you do in your leasure time but just consider my words for a moment.</p>
<p>While others say:</p>
<p>&gt;Don't belive these people who say it's a satire... I've been doing some research too and Shelley is on all kind of serious Republican web rings.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;She even has a GOP site: <a href="http://shelley.gop.com/">http://shelley.gop.com/</a> and appears to be on the Republican National Committee: <a href="http://www.gop.com/Blog/BlogProfile.aspx?nickname=shelley">http://www.gop.com/Blog/BlogProfile.aspx?nickname=shelley</a><br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Just because her opinions are unpalatable, that doesn't mean that they aren't real. And just because they get facts wrong that doesn't mean they aren't in earnest. i mean, look at George Bush. When has he ever got his research right, but we take him serious enough.</p>
<p>So, what is this?</p>
