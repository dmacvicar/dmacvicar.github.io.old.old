title: skype c++ library

> ++Skype is a C++ library for skype add-on platform independent software development. It is platform independent, easy to use, and easy to extend because of the flexible library design, inspired by modern C++ design ideas. Performance is one of the goals: only compile-time polymorphism is used.

(got my attention as Kopete has a [skype plugin][4], using dbus though a thin layer IIRC.)

[home page here][1], [getting started here][2], [tutorial here][3].

It is LGPL. The last version can control Skype not only via dbus, but also via the X11 protocol.
