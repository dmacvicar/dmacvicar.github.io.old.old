> OpenSUSE Drops ZENworks, Opens YAST

A simple query for ["yast gpl"][2] shows that YaST is opensourced, in fact GPLed, since 2004 or so. What we did was opening up the repositories.

Formerly, the YaST external code repository was a snapshot of the internal one. It was synced on every release. Now, we will develop only on the external one, so you can follow real time commits, or participate.
