<p>Last week I blogged about <a href="http://duncan.mac-vicar.com/blog/archives/541">http://duncan.mac-vicar.com/blog/archives/541</a>, just after I<br />
was able to see my buddies for first time on the screen.</p>
<p>Since then I have made some improvements to message handling and other<br />
code cleanups. The code is now available in a <a href="http://github.com/dmacvicar/kopete-facebook">http://github.com/dmacvicar/kopete-facebook</a> at<br />
github.</p>
<p>As KDEâ€™s svn trunk is frozen, I will keep it there for now.</p>
<p>You can get <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3AFactory&amp;p=1&amp;q=kde4-kopete-protocol-facebook">http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3AFactory&amp;p=1&amp;am...</a> (version 0.1.2). I gave<br />
up trying to build it for openSUSE 11.1, as Kopete API has changed quite<br />
a bit. However the package may build on 11.1 plus the KDE 4.2+<br />
repositories. You need <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3AFactory&amp;p=1&amp;q=qjson">http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3AFactory&amp;p=1&amp;am...</a> installed (or<br />
-devel package if you want to build it).</p>
<p>Roadmap for next 0.1.3:</p>
<p>Add caching to avoid downloading the pictures every 3 minutes.</p>
<p>More bugfixes</p>
<p>Roadmap for later:</p>
<p>Look into adding , searching, and other stuff.</p>
<p>Be aware. This is weeks-old-code. It has not been tested much and has<br />
lot of debug messages. Use it if you are a early adopter only.</p>
