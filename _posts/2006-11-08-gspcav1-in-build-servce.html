<p>
    You may know that in the drivers:webcam project of the [openSUSE][2] build service you find a repository with the spca5xx package, which includes drivers for lot of webcams.</p>
<p>Since kernel 2.6.11 is out, this driver set was renamed to gspcav1  ( Generic Softwares Package for Camera Adaptator ). I planned since some weeks to package it, but never pop out of my TODO. Even if I needed to, because spca5xx never worked with my camera after a kernel upgrade.</p>
<p>That is the cool thing about the build service. If someone else does it, it can be put in the same automated place and share maintenance with more people. [Martin][1] came to my office and told me that he had a package for gspcav1. woooho. cool. So now it is in the same repository among the old spca5xx (for use with kernels below 2.6.11). Enjoy it.</p>
