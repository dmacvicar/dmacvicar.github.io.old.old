<p>
    I just tried the travel plan service [TripIt][1].</p>
<p>![tripit logo](<a href="http://www.tripit.com/images/header/logo.gif)">http://www.tripit.com/images/header/logo.gif)</a></p>
<p>TripIt idea is: You open an account, forward your flight/hotel/car/restaurant reservations to <a href="mailto:plans@tripit.com">plans@tripit.com</a> and it automatically reads the information from there and creates a nice itinerary you can print. It also combines it with mashup information: maps, weather, pictures, etc.</p>
<p>I tried it forwarding my flight confirmation I got from [TerminalA.com][3]. However, it failed to read it and it stayed in a special inbox of items it cannot deal with. I copy pasted the reservation code to the amadeus system in [checkmytrip.com][2] and then used the "Sent to a friend" option of checkmytrip to send the reservation from my address to the <a href="mailto:plans@tripit.com">plans@tripit.com</a> email. This time I was lucky and after refreshing the tripIt page, my flight details were there.</p>
<p>Then I started to explore the site. The printing options are nice. You can also get a private address (URI) for a remote [ICal][4] calendar you can use to merge your travel itineraries into popular calendar applications (or your google calendar, for example).</p>
<p>The site is useful. I will keep my account, mostly for printing and calendaring. But I am a little bit dissapointed. I was expecting more. Perhaps I am just sick of signing up again and again to every new site. OpenID now!</p>
