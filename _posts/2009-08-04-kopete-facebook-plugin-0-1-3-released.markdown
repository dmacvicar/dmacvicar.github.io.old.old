Available for [openSUSE Factory in my home project](http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3AFactory&p=1&q=kde4-kopete-protocol-facebook). I also submitted to the KDE:KDE4:Factory:Desktop project where you may find it built for older releases using a newer KDE.

### Changes:

- Some connection fixes
- The idle status icon is now shown
- Basic user info widget ( [bug #198286](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198286))
- Show contact status message! ( [bug #198284](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198284))
- build system improvements
- [qjson](http://qjson.sourceforge.net/) 0.6.x is now required

### Known bugs:

- The plugin crashes when exiting Kopete. Some weird stuff with “myself” contact which seems to be deleted twice

Note:  
_This plugin is not associated with Facebook in any way_.
