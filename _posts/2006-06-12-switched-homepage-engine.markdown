My old homepage was a mixture of handmade php pages and the blog was powered by [blogger][1]

However I wanted to mix my old KDE blog, with this one, and provide feeds to planet-like aggregators based on categories. Yes, I don't like the idea of my weekend photos to appear in a tech-aggregator. And blogger does not yet support categories, and every day it seems to suck more.

After playing with wordpress and the [markdown][2] plugin, it became confortable enough to switch. And with the help of [a simple script][3] I found in the net I was able to convert most pages to the simplistic markdown. I was sick of using html to write posts. Not because WYSIWYG editor are not good, but I want to store my posts in a more human readable format.

Let's see how it goes.
