Tech news sites have been reporting since a few weeks about a tool included in Sony music CDs, which acts like a virus, installing itself in the computer to make it unable to copy the music on the cd.

The justification for those aggresive methods (which includes violating user's private property) has been always the right they have to protect their intellectual property.

But, now a Security company is saying this "virus" includes pieces of software that are opensource and published under the GPL and LGPL licenses, without any notice where to get the source code, or source code itself, and linked inside an executable. This is a violation of the intellectual property of the authors of those opensource software.

Now, the problem here is:

Sony is using this virus which install itself in the computer, assuming the user is a pirate, not giving the oportunity to the user to being honest by their own. This means basically, that not all users who play CDs are pirates. But if this copyright infringement stuff is proven, Sony \_will\_ be a pirate.

Ironic? isn't it?
