Google just launched [Picassa web][1]. I am waiting for my preview invitation.

![Google Picassa Web][2]

If it is better than flickr, it would be strange, as I would like to move all my pictures, but [social applications's][3] (where you can link to other people) value is not determined by the features and price (well, only for the first ones) but by the amount of people using it. So, if Google would allow to link to flickr people, so I can see the new pictures of my friends in my feeds, or they manage to move them all to Google, then you have a chance for me to move.
