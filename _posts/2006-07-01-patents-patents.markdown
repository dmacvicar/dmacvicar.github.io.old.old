Another boring case if a failure company that needs some cash so they go the "sue just in case we win" business model.

No I am not talking about SCO. This time is Firestar. They patented [Object Relational Mapping][2] in the year 2000. That technique is pretty obvious. Most developers have written their own mapper for simple purposes, even without knowing how to do it because it is likely you will always came with the same solution.

They were not the first ones. Next introduced [Enterprise Objects Framework][2] in 1994, and it has everything (and more) Firestar describes in the patent. There should be also lot of tiny less serious implementations made by developers around the net by these years. Basically the patent is invalid.

The most known object relational mapper in the Java enterprise world is Hibernate, which is an opensource project. Hibernate was latter part of the bigger [opensource project JBoss][3], and the company behing JBoss (called by the same name) was acquired by Redhat some months ago.

So Firestar saw a nice opportunity to get some cash and sue.

This again shows that US patent system is full and overloaded of stupid, invalid obvious patents. And this shows again how any centralized system sucks, like the process the patent office uses to grant patents. Patents (if they should exist at all) should be reviewed in a peer to peer based process, where everyone could provide information of prior art. Redhat can spend a bunch of millions defending themselfes against them, but small companies and developers can't, so the whole system is flawed.

I hope they get crushed like a bug in the court. And if that happens the same day SCO files for bankrupcy, a nice party could be made.
