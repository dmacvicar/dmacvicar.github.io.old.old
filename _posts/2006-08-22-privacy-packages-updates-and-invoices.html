    Sometime ago [I blogged about Tor][4], a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system, and some nice utilities to control it. Since that that I am maintaining some packages in the [security:privacy][5] repository in the [OpenSUSE build service][6].</p>
<p>Today updated Tor to the lastest version. The KDE front-end TorK is also there.<br />
Surfing, I found the [Vidalia Project][3], which provides a cross-platform frontend based on Qt 4.1. I packaged it and added it to the repository, although it is not built yet as either there are some missing packages in the base repository or I did some dumb mistake.</p>
<p>Also, surfing I found this [funny post][1], where Guy Kewney, from Newswireless.net sends an "open invoice" to Bill Gates, complaining how Windows Update screwed up his system. Probably Mr. Kewney did not read the EULA of the software he bought.</p>
<p>&gt; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES. Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, all damages referenced above and all direct or general damages), the entire liability of Microsoft and any of its suppliers under any provision of this EULA and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing (except for any remedy of repair or replacement elected by Microsoft with respect to any breach of the Limited Warranty) shall be limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by you for the Product or U.S.$5.00. The foregoing limitations, exclusions, and disclaimers (including Sections 9 and 10 above and as stated in the Limited Warranty) shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, even if any remedy fails its essential purpose.</p>
<p>Proprietary and expensive software does not give you any additional warranty, Mr. Kewney. Actually this myth was used years ago to spread FUD against opensource: "opensource software" does not give you any warranty. Sorry, proprietary does not. So enjoy learning the available opensource software while Bill Gates uses your invoice as a prop for his desk. You will get as maximum what you paid for the software, or U.S.$5.00., even if you get the second should be enough to get a Linux DVD from the net.</p>
<p>In other news, [Department of Defense study urges open source adoption][2].</p>
