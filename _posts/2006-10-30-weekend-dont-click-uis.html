    As I survived last Sunday, Will tried again. This time the place was tiergarten (zoo).  Ciaran also joined.<br />
The trail of last week was completely flat. This was not, and we did 49 km instead of the 38 km last week.  I survivived!, but my bike did not. Some pieces need replacement.</p>
<p>[We need to buy Will a gps][3]. I will setup a .org site and paypal donations soon.</p>

<p>[This website][1] claims to be a research center testing don't-click style interfaces. But the first don't click application I used comes from the Kaserne labs at SUSE. It is nothing less than [Kickoff][2], the new KDE menu present in 10.2 betas, and I am a complete fan of it.</p>
