I use the Firefox addon [Performancing][1] which is started with a click in Firefox status bar. Is simple, can be configured for multiple blogs, supports WYSIWYG editing (I have that disabled, as I use [Markdown][2] in my blog), and supports adding images either by url or uploading them to ftp. Give it a try.
