* Ate stuff I missed so much. [paila marina][2] ([south's version][6]), [machas][3], and did real [asados][4].  
* Big [event][7] at [home][8]!, met lot of friends.  
* [Met][2] [family][1]!  
* [Showed Loreto][11] [how beautiful][12] is Chile.  
* Air France was pretty good. And the way via Paris seems less stressing than via Frankfurt.  
* Brought lot of stuff I left there when I moved to Germany.
