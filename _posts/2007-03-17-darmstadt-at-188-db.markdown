I am at the basysKom GmbH offices in Darmstadt, attending a Decibel meeting.

The goal of the meeting is to discuss various requirements and design decisions around [Decibel][2], an architecture to make chat and phone communication universally available to desktop applications. [Akonadi][5], the extensible cross-desktop storage service for PIM data and meta data. And [Khalkhi][3], a plugin-based contact framework.

Attending the meeting are: Will Stephenson (Kopete), Friedrich (Khalkhi author), Volker Krause (Akonadi developer), Tobias Hunger (Decibel), Stanislav Karchebny ([Skype][4]), Dominik Haumann (Kate), and myself , trying to get back on KDE track, or at least follow the track.

Will post updates later.
