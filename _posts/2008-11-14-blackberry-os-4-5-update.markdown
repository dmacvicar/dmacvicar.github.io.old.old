If you own a Blackberry from Vodafone Germany, you may be able to update to OS 4.5 depending on your model.  
I did the update yesterday, and it went smooth. You will need:

* Windows machine, as the update is done from the desktop manager  
* [The right firmware update for your model][1].  
* You need to re-activate against the Enterprise Server in case you use BES. Contact your administrator for that.

You get lot of improvements against 4.2:

* Better browser. Mouse cursor to navigate.  
* HTML mails  
* Video camera.  
* Some Media Player enhancements.  
* Decent fonts.  
* Documents to go. I can now even open pdfs from mail.  
* Lot of user interface improvements. It looks nicer.  
* Free/Busy calendar lookup.

(note, features depend on your device model)
