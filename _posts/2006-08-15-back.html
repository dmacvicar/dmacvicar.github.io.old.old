    Well, I blamed my harddrive, but it was the Factory kernel. I booted with a livecd and fsck.ext3 found no problem accessing the drive. Booting the installed system using the 10.1 DVD kernel worked. Now I have to find out why the new kernel has this regression in Factory, and look for a replacement kernel as I don't want to keep booting from CD and manually load drivers.</p>
