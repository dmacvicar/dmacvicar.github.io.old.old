    Some days ago I got in my google news alerts an [article from Reuters][1] titled "Novell-Could-Be-Banned-From-Selling-Linux". I found it really interesting as most of the heat and FUD are gone since a few weeks.</p>
<p>Today the article was [picked by OSNews][2], and I thought "Oh no.... here we go again".</p>
<p>But the OSNews story, had an update:</p>
<p>&gt;Update: [The FSF claims this is being hyped][4].</p>
<p>So, [last week prize for research lazyness][3] was awarded to Dan Nicolae Alexa.</p>
<p>This week prize for FUD, and "unnecessary waves" goes to Jim Finkle.</p>
