    I don't like to read about Mid East politics in planetsuse, as I don't like to everyday be informed about private life of developers. Some times there are exceptions  it is ok to see a vacation photo or some mumbling and ranting. It is even desirable. I respect other's people blogging style so I just filter by topic and I just hope others do the same. I confess sometime I skip the filter because some planets give you some audience. So tagging for planetsuse or planetkde, etc is a good way when I want to create polemic with some post/rant.</p>
<p>[Miguel][2] is one of our bloggers who keep planetsuse updated with a weekly politics analysis of this chaotic world. [His last post][1] caught my attention, as it is an opinion related to Chile:</p>
<p>&gt;The same folks that were calling for "Iraqi Liberation" from Saddam are now pitching the need for a strong man. They never made any sense, but they are now venturing into new delusional grounds when they suggest that Augusto Pinochet is a good model to follow.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Of course, this particular columnist has always shown the intellectual prodigy of a clam, the wit and finese of a dumb rock.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;His claim: Pinochet's abuses "helped create a civil society". Well, you can not get any dumber than that. All he knows about Chile he probably learned this week.</p>
<p>The journalist makes a big mistake when saying "the abuses created", the abuses created nothing more than fear and deaths.</p>
<p>However, the topic is much more complex that that, and the world shows lot of arrogance when talking about the topic.<br />
This arrogance created a partial justice, which resulted in the military dictatorship being pure evil and the anti-democratic government of Allende in a process of international canonization. This attempt to make justice in just *one* side is what resulted in no justice at all, and still creates division and hate in the Chilean society.</p>
<p>So, it can get dumber than that. No big difference in an american conservative who learned about Chile this week, and any other auto proclaimed Chilean history expert.</p>
