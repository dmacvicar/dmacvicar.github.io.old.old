    From slashdot:</p>
<p>&gt; "The San Francisco Chronicle reports that AT&amp;T has revamped its privacy policy, in an effort to head off future consumer lawsuits,  with changes taking effect this Friday. AT&amp;T is introducing a new policy that gives it more 'latitude' when it comes to sharing your browsing history with government agencies. Notable changes include notification that AT&amp;T will track viewing habits of customers of its new video services Homezone and U-Verse, which is forbidden for cable and satellite companies, as well as explicitly stating that the customer's data belongs to the company: 'While your account information may be personal to you, these records constitute business records that are owned by AT&amp;T. As such, AT&amp;T may disclose such records to protect its legitimate business interests, safeguard others, or respond to legal process."</p>
