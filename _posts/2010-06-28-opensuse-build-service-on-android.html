<p>Release fast, release early. That is what I am trying this time so don&rsquo;t get too excited. I only added one feature. Yes one.</p>
<p>You can list the pending submit requests related to you. Nothing else. And not with a very pretty layout
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed">

</div>
<p> but it will get better.</p>
<p>However, I have an infrastructure in place that will allow me to consume the API very easily, and I will push new versions every time I add something.</p>
<p>What I want to add next?</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the user interface so that it looks pretty</li>
<li>Ability to act on a request and see the diff (colored!)</li>
<li>Explore projects and packages</li>
<li>A service that polls for build failures and show notifications. Same for requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t plan to implement the whole user interface in a phone, but mostly the parts where a phone makes a good tool for the build service. Do you have an idea? Screen mockup? Share it with me!</p>

<p>To try it, just search &ldquo;opensuse&rdquo; in the market. The code is available <a href="http://gitorious.org/opensuse/obs-client-android">here</a>.</p>
