DistroWatch [praising zypper][1]:

> During my usage of Zypper over the past couple of weeks, I've learnt to appreciate the convenience it provides to the end user. There is not doubt in my mind that Zypper is the most powerful package management utility available today

Even further goes CNET with their [review][2].

> I’d have to say that next to Mac, this is probably the most beautiful installer program I have ever seen. Beauty isn’t just skin deep, however — a lot of time and work has been invested to make the SUSE installer faster and easier to use.

You can read more about the installer and a short interview with Stephan Kulow [here][3].

And the last great paragraph:

> If Ubuntu is a Volkswagen, then OpenSUSE is a Mercedes-Benz.
