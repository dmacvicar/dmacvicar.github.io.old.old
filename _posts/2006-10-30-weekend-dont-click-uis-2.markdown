As I survived last Sunday, Will tried again. This time the place was tiergarten (zoo). Ciaran also joined.  
The trail of last week was completely flat. This was not, and we did 49 km instead of the 38 km last week. I survivived!, but my bike did not. Some pieces need replacement.

[We need to buy Will a gps][3]. I will setup a .org site and paypal donations soon.

[This website][1] claims to be a research center testing don't-click style interfaces. But the first don't click application I used comes from the Kaserne labs at SUSE. It is nothing less than [Kickoff][2], the new KDE menu present in 10.2 betas, and I am a complete fan of it.
