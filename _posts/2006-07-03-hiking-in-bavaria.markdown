Weekend trip! We started from Garmisch-Partenkirchen. From there we started hiking till [Höllentalhütte][3] (1.381 m). We had dinner (and knew that England was out of the WM2006) and slept there. Next day when waking up we were told about Brazil and France.

The way is pretty cool, most of it by the border of a mountain and the river, with some tunnels and bridges. Next day we went down a little bit and took the way to the [Eibsee][2]. We had lunch there and rented a pedal boat and did a round around the lake. Then we took the telepheric to the [Zugspitze][1], the highest mountain in Germany (2.962 m).

Bavaria is beautiful. Green, full of nature and lot of interesting places to visit. [Complete photo set here][4]
