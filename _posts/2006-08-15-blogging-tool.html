<p>&gt;Anyone with a good suggestion for a _usable_ blogging tool that also allows adding pictures without clicking hundreds of buttons for each?<br />
&gt;This and the fact that some features of the crappy web frontend of Blogger did not work at all were the reasons I did not post recently and why I will make all this here less frequent and shorter.</p>
<p>I use the Firefox addon [Performancing][1] which is started with a click in Firefox status bar. Is simple, can be configured for multiple blogs, supports WYSIWYG editing (I have that disabled, as I use [Markdown][2] in my blog), and supports adding images either by url or uploading them to ftp. Give it a try.</p>
