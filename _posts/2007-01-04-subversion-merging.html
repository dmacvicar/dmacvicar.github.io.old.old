<p>
    Subversion does not make the task of merging multiple branches easy. Just discovered svnmerge.py.</p>
<p>The tutorial and downloads links [are here][1]. There are three use cases: development branch, release branch, and merging<br />
branches back to trunk. You can do any combination of them at the same time.</p>
<p>Merge information is stored as standard svn properties!</p>
<p>(I am standing in a clean trunk checkout)</p>
<p>    dmacvicar@piscola:/space/sources/trunk/myproject&gt; svnmerge.py avail<br />
    4711-4712,4721,4731,4733,4735-4736,4741-4746</p>
<p>(if I am tracking more than 1 branch, I need to specify it, here it assumed I<br />
asked for 1.0-Branch)</p>
<p>You can block certain revisions to be shown as available ( for example stuff that I<br />
don't want to integrate from 1.0-Branch into trunk) and you can also query<br />
the integrated revisions.</p>
<p>Finally, you can merge:</p>
<p>    svnmerge.py merge --bidirectional</p>
<p>it does not commit for you, of course.</p>
<p>You can see how they are stored as svn properties:</p>
<p>    dmacvicar@piscola:/space/sources/trunk/myproject&gt; svn pg svnmerge-integrated<br />
    /branches/1.0-Branch/myproject:1-4704</p>
