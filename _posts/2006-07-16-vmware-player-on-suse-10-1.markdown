While trying to install the rpm for [VMWare Player][2] on 10.1 I noticed the kernel modules don't compile.

To make it work, install the rpm, get [this tar.gz][1], unpack it, run the script as root, it will patch your vmware player. Then rerun vmware-config to build the kernel modules.

I wonder [if it is legal][4] to package vmware player as a rpm in the [OpenSUSE Build Service][3], to get the modules ready for the SUSE kernel. Then SUSE users could just install from the [autogenerated YUM repos][5] from the build service. Anyone?
