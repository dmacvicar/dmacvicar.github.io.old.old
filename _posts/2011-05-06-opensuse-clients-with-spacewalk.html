<p>My team has been busy the last months with the release of <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/suse-manager/">SUSE Manager</a>, which was received with <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Novell-SUSE-Manager-12-Taps-Red-Hat-Technology-to-Rein-In-Enterprise-Linux-Servers-815712/">very good reviews</a>. There is lot of room for improvements, some of them specific to SUSE products/integration but others in Spacewalk itself.</p>
<p>There is lot of work to do and lot of <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/search?a=1&amp;l=spacewalk-devel%40redhat.com&amp;haswords=PATCH+%22%40suse.de%22&amp;from=&amp;notwords=&amp;subject=&amp;datewithin=1d&amp;date=&amp;order=relevance&amp;search=Search">patches being reviewed</a>. Lot of them are <a href="http://miroslav.suchy.cz/spacewalk/gitstat/changelog-find.php?search_opt=3&amp;search3=suse&amp;submit=1&amp;page=">already upstream</a>.</p>
<p>One common question is: if I already have a Spacewalk server, how do I setup openSUSE clients?</p>
<p>Thanks to Michael Calmer, we submitted the required packages to a <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/spacewalk:/1.4/openSUSE_11.4">repository in the openSUSE Build Service</a>. You can find the instructions looking for the SUSE section in the<a href="https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/RegisteringClients"> "Registering Clients" page of the official Spacewalk wiki.</a></p>
