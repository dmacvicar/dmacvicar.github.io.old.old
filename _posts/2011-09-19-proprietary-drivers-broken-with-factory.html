<p>
ld.so.conf seems to have changed to include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, proprietary drivers like the NVIDIA installed a file without the .conf extension. Therefore XOrg did not find the custom openGL library included by the driver.</p>
<p>Tracked as <a href="http://bugzilla.novell.com/718734" title="bug 718734">bug 718734</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Admacvicar%3Abranches%3AX11%3ADrivers%3AVideo">home:dmacvicar:branches:X11:Drivers:Video</a> contains a fixed nvidia-gfxG02 (Also updated to 280.13).</p>
