    I usually keep an eye on free Windows applications in order to recommend them when friends/family using Windows need help.</p>
<p>With Firefox, ThunderBird and others, Windows users don't really need to go trough the pain of using Internet Explorer. However, for long time they did not have something cool as [amaroK][2] to play music and they were forced to the mediocrity of Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>[Musikcube][1] seems to be a free alternative for Windows user. If you try it, please give me feedback.</p>
