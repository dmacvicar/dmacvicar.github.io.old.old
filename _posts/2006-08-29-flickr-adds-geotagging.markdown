[Yahoo added geotagging features][1] to Flickr. That means you can say where the photo was taken using Yahoo maps.

Some cameras have a gps device built in that add the geo location in the picture file itself. If not, [here][3] and [here][2] you can find how to use a normal gps device to tag your photos easily.
