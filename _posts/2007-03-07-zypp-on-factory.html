<p>
    This week we are integrating a new libzypp which uses a new build system and a new .so version, which will be the base to integrate 10.3 features.</p>
<p>This uncovered some problems with link order and static initialization which we are solving this week. So it is very likely applications will crash/segfault.</p>
<p>The integration of new packages had some effect in zypp stack. Like a curl bug affecting ftp source probing, which is [now fixed][1].</p>
<p>So be careful, I'd recommend to install / update the package manager stack only in a virtual machine this week.</p>
<p>Also, we updated [the instructions how to build][2] for this new series.</p>
