    If you own a Blackberry from Vodafone Germany, you may be able to update to OS 4.5 depending on your model.<br />
I did the update yesterday, and it went smooth. You will need:</p>
<p>* Windows machine, as the update is done from the desktop manager<br />
* [The right firmware update for your model][1].<br />
* You need to re-activate against the Enterprise Server in case you use BES. Contact your administrator for that.</p>
<p>You get lot of improvements against 4.2:</p>
<p>* Better browser. Mouse cursor to navigate.<br />
* HTML mails<br />
* Video camera.<br />
* Some Media Player enhancements.<br />
* Decent fonts.<br />
* Documents to go. I can now even open pdfs from mail.<br />
* Lot of user interface improvements. It looks nicer.<br />
* Free/Busy calendar lookup.</p>
<p>(note, features depend on your device model)</p>
