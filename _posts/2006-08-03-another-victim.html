<p>
    [Lenz][1] is now [using the build service][2], and his packages are [here now][3], what are you waiting for?. Cool people use the cool build service. </p>
<p>Next step? make community. Once you have enough packages in your home project find who are using them, and create a project and share maintainance with other people.<br />
Right now the organization is weird. Subversion has it own project. I would like to see them in a vcs project, so Lenz could move mercurial there in the future.</p>
<p>Why use it? because it is free and does a great job. Also the SUSE team working on it s only cool people, in order to guarantee a cool product.<br />
It will be easier as well to create a catalog of available repositories from the community, and a nice way to present them to the user, to add at own risk, without need to know urls.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to document something, create a tutorial, etc. Use the wiki!</p>
