![SUSE Logo][9] I have been playing a lot with the [OpenSUSE build service][7]. I can only say that it rocks. I can also say the [KMP standard][8] to do kernel modules is also great, so kudos for the SUSE kernel team.

As a result of this, I have packages the following packages ready. To use them, just add the repo url as a installation source:

* [TrueCrypt][1] - [repository][4]  
* [spca5xx webcam driver][3] - [repository][3]  
* [gnash][5] - [repository][6]
