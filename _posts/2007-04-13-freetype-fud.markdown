title: freetype FUD

This week we had a new FUD wave. ClearType was disabled in the freetype library because Microsoft patents, and inmediately a bunch of conspiracy theories came back to life. The point is, it was a upstream change, so it will affect lot of distributions.

The chain seems to be openSUSE bugzilla to [Beranger.org][4] to Roy Schestowitz from the FUD kings of Boycott Novell and then [kripken][2] in [a slashdot post][1].

What is totally crazy is the [comment][3] kripken posted on slashdot:

> Apparently the Microsoft-Novell deal doesn't help openSUSE out much with regard to MS patents. Is the same true for SUSE?

Do you guys put the same energy on reading [FAQs][5] you spend spreading FUD? Novell has been repeating all the time:

* Novell has no license for Microsoft patents.  
* Novell can't use Microsoft patents (and viceversa)  
* Novell can sue Microsoft for Novell patents in Microsoft products (and viceversa)  
* Novell CAN'T sue Microsoft customers for patents (and viceversa)
