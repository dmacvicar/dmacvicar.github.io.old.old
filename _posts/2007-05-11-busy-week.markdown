This has been a really busy week. Moving to a new apartment. At home I only see boxes everywhere :-(

Lot of news coming from the Java field. I am happy for what is happening with the Java world.

* The strategy for Solaris finally makes some sense: making it like Linux, but with its own strengths. Everyone will win here. (it will be GPL soon][1] ). The only looser will be Microsoft and whose can't use GPL code. I am not sure if the strategy is right, but making Sun a player with both Linux and Solaris is much better than the "Linux, eeer Solaris, er Linux... Solaris!... Linux!" strategy.  
* Flash and Silverlight will get a competitor from [Sun and the Java world][2]. This is good news for Linux, as it can be the first [free solution][3] on this platform. Watch the [demos][4].  
* Platform [for cellphones][5].  
* [There is a video of a Google Earth][8] like client done by Sun and NASA, based on the new FX technologies. It will be free and can be used as a component in Java programs.

Also:

* Give a look to this [Xen virtual machine manager][6] (Enomalism) and the [vmcasting rss based format][7]  
* [PlanetSUSE][9] has a new logo
