    Together with the launch of SUSE Studio 1.0, an alpha demo of WebYaST was also included in the Appliance Kit preview. We <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2009/02/03/yast-web/">talked about WebYaST</a> earlier this year. The demo includes small functionality like setting the system language, system time, patches/updates and general status of your appliance.</p>
<p>WebYaST mission is to add value to your appliance by providing the basic setup requiring only a web browser. The idea is that you build your appliance with Studio and include WebYaST so you can perform setup, configuration and basic monitoring.</p>

<p>The WebYaST demo is available as an appliance (built with SUSE Studio) on the <a href="http://www.novell.com/partners/technology/isv/appliance/program.html">Novell Appliance Program page</a>. Advanced users can follow the YaST:Web repository on the openSUSE Build Service.</p>
