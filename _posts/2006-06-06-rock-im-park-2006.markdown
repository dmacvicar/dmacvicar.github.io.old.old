I was yesterday in Rock Im Park. I only went to see Metallica. The show was great, the (long) playlist was something like:

* Creeping death  
 \* Fuel  
 \* The God that failed  
 \* Wherever I may roam

* Battery  
 \* Master of Puppets  
 \* The Thing That Should Not Be  
 \* Welcome Home (Sanitarium)  
 \* Disposable Heroes  
 \* Leper Messiah  
 \* Orion (Instrumental)  
 \* Damage, Inc.

(yeah, they played the whole Master of Puppets album because it was its 20th birthday)

* Nothing else matters  
 \* Sad but true  
 \* One  
 \* Enter Sandman  
 \* So What  
 \* Seek and destroy
