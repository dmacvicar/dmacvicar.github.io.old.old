Upgraded to [nvidia beta driver 1.0-9625][1] and my desktop machine feels usable again. For months it was slower than my laptop. Now it feels responsive.

My old T22 laptop received a memory, battery and wlan upgrade. All from ebay. I just like it so I did not feel like changing it yet.

Also I found some time to re-setup my KDE4 development environment.
