I am having great time with [my brother][1] in NÃ¼rnberg. We managed to spend Christmas together in a "family" way even with the other half of the family being overseas. We kept the other half updated with real time photos of our culinary creation:

Also, lot of party on the weekend. Tomorrow we fly to Barcelona.

Happy Christmas and New Year to everyone!
