I am back in Germany. I woke up at 3 am, because the cabs were going to come at 4 am. At the airport I had a nice cup of black coffee, first with Alfredo Beaumont and his friend, and later I found a sleepy Aaron in the coffee queue (photo coming later).

I had great time. It was cool to see Olivier and kwwii again, to met Michael, Johann, Aaron, Kevin O. and others.

The flights were ok. I still don't understand why I had to go through airport security (again) and passport check in Frankfurt. What happened to the EU?.

I took a long nap once at home. I think I could still sleep a whole day.  
Laurent Montel just merged my qca cmake patch with his own and commited it.
