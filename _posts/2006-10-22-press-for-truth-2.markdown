Recently in some blog someone recommended to watch [Press for truth][1].

Today I saw it, and I muss say that it is a really good documentary. Give a look to the [timeline][5] which is hosted in the cooperative research framework. The idea is interesting as it can be used by different groups in the society to do research the burochratic system can't, either for capacity or political reasons (like the 9/11 ) case.
