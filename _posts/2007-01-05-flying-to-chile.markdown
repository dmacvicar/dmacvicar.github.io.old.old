On Monday night we came back from Barcelona. We did not arrive until Tuesday morning though. The airplane had problems before taking off and we lost our connection to NÃ¼rnberg in Frankfurt. Lufthansa sent us to an hotel. On Tuesday, directly from the airport to work.

New year in Barcelona was nice. [The place we chose][1] to go after dinner was great. I can't post photos yet because I forgot my camera in Barcelona.

My brother went back to Paris today. I fly today to Chile. My first time since I moved to Germany. Excited!!!
