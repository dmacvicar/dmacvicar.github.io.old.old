Surprised to find out that Chris is writing Taskjuggler3 from scratch, and this time, in Ruby:

TaskJuggler 3.x is a from-scratch rewrite of TaskJuggler. It's currently in its infancy and only supports a minimum feature set. It is not intended for users yet. Please join our developer forum if you are interested in contributing. In contrast to the 2.x version TaskJuggler 3.x is written in Ruby.

There is a git repository in

http://www.taskjuggler.org/git-repos/taskjuggler3.git

in case you want to give it a look.
