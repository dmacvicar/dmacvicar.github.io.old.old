The sun shines over NÃ¼rnberg. The air is cold and fresh. I like this combination.

Yesterday Paella at the Galician centre. Then [pisco sour][5] at home with Will.

Loreto approved the Paella!, not bad, considering Paella is not galician food they did it quite good. Fotos coming.

I need to give a look to [this libraries from Adobe][1], they just [started a review process][3] to be accepted in [boost][6]. [Presentation here][2]. On the other hand, the [pimpl\_ptr library was rejected][4].
