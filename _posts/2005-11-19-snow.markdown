yeah, nothing uncommon for most people, but for me it is really new!. And we are still in autum.

The picture is not really good. It was taken by a collegue with a cell phone. The shutter is unable to catch the falling snow. But you can already notice some white color on the trees.

Anyway it is really good. The previous days were dark, cold, with dark clouds.
