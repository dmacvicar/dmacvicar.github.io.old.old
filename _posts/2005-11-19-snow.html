<p>yeah, nothing uncommon for most people, but for me it is really new!. And we are still in autum.</p>
<p>The picture is not really good. It was taken by a collegue with a cell phone. The shutter is unable to catch the falling snow. But you can already notice some white color on the trees.</p>
<p>Anyway it is really good. The previous days were dark, cold, with dark clouds.</p>
