This worldcup is so boring. Long 0-0 matches and full of delays, fouls, and non-play stuff. If I am happy about Italy is because they provided me 2 minutes of soccer action I was expecting to get for the whole match.

I am not sad about Germany, after seeing Ballack doing fake fouls, I completely banned the team from my favorites. I can tolerate exagerating the fouls, but inventing a non-existing one is another problem.

I am not sad about Chile not being in the world cup. Not as long as soccer players keep having this star status.  
Normal people get up early and work 8 hours per day and receive a reasonable amount of money. If they do bad, they get fired. Or they get less money. Chilean "stars" don't seem to take their job seriously.

Italy is the world champion already, in football acting. Just look at this video of the Italian team training:

Soccer never was so boring like it is these days.
