From [OSNews][1]:

> Trolltech, the originator of Qt, which forms the basis of the Linux KDE desktop environment, is being acquired by Nokia, the world's number-one mobile phone vendor. Nokia expects its acquisition of Trolltech to accelerate its cross-platform software strategy for mobile devices and desktop applications, and to enhance its Internet services business. The original press release is also available. Update: "We will continue to actively develop Qt and Qtopia. We also want to underline that we will continue to support the open source community by continuing to release these technologies under the GPL."

Some [gnomies][4] are already starting to panic. What will happen to [Maemo][5]? Has Symbian reason to panic too? ;-)

Was this move motivated by [Android][6] ?
